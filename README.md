# OpenKitchen

## Inspiration

We saw a gap in the recipe world â€“ tired cookbooks, expensive subscriptions, and unreliable YouTube tutorials. We craved a platform bursting with fresh culinary inspiration, free for all.

## What it does

Open Kitchen empowers everyone to share and discover delicious recipes. Our platform features a community upvote/downvote system, ensuring you find the most-loved dishes.

## How we built it

We created a web-based front end using React and Vite. We made our backend using Python and Flask for the API, with a cloud-based MongoDB database.

## Challenges we ran into

We did not have any experience developing websites, so we ended up spending a lot of time on otherwise basic elements of our website. We also had some trouble setting up a cloud-based database solution, though it did prove to be more robust than other options.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Not only did we learn something completely new in fewer than 24 hours, but we also managed to win the midnight capture the flag game. Overall has been a gratifying experience.

## What we learned

We all had an educational first experience with developing for the web. Before the hackathon, we had no idea how to go make a full web app. Now, we have a solid understanding of how to create and connect the front end and back end.

## What's next for Open Kitchen

We want to add AI-based tools to help people write and find recipes quickly. We also want to improve the search functions to allow users to search by ingredient or meal. Finally, a mobile app could definitely be in the works in the future.
